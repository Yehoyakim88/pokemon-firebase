# NgbytesFirepokedex

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.4.

This app is a Pokedex CRUD application using Angular 14, Firebaseâ€™s real-time NoSQL cloud database (Firestore), and the new tree-shakable AngularFire v.7.0 modular SDK, which allows us to take full advantage of the new tree-shakable Firebase JS SDK (v9).

A preview of the app can be seen on the tutor's tutorial page: https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*RiFtaZT3BkXzfIUncVmlDA.gif

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
